# 🥁 Nathan Lewis - Portfolio Website

Welcome to my Portfolio Website! This is where I showcase my journey as a developer, the projects I've been working on, and my blog posts about various topics in the tech industry.

🌍 Hosted on Netlify

📝 Content managed with Sanity.io

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React**: Frontend framework
- **Sanity.io**: Headless CMS for managing content
- **Phosphor Icons**: For beautiful icons
- **React Router**: For handling page routing
- **Date-fns**: For working with dates

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

Follow these commands to start the application locally:

### 1. Running the Portfolio Website

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the React application.

### 2. Running Sanity Studio

```bash
yarn start:studio
```

This command will start Sanity Studio, which allows you to manage the content for the website locally. You can update the website content directly through Sanity and see the changes in both development and production environments.

## 🌱 Content Management

With **Sanity Studio**, I can update blog posts, projects, and general content dynamically in both development and production. No need to redeploy the site for content changes—it's all handled through the CMS!

## 📂 Scripts

- **`yarn start`**: Runs the application in development mode.
- **`yarn start:studio`**: Starts Sanity Studio locally.
- **`yarn build`**: Builds the application for production.
- **`yarn test`**: Launches the test runner in interactive mode.
