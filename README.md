🚀 How to Run Locally
Follow these commands to start the application locally:

1. Running the Portfolio Website
   bash
   Copy code
   yarn start
   This will start the React application.

2. Running Sanity Studio
   bash
   Copy code

   This command will start Sanity Studio, which allows you to manage the content for the website locally. You can update the website content directly through Sanity and see the changes in both development and production environments.

🌱 Content Management
With Sanity Studio, I can update blog posts, projects, and general content dynamically in both development and production. No need to redeploy the site for content changes—it's all handled through the CMS!
